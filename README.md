## **Your User stories – who are your users, what do they want and why?**
***
* As a user, I want it to be clear whose turn it is.
* As a user, I want to be able to see my score and my opponents score
* As a user, I want to know who the winner is when the game is over
* As a user, I want to be able to play again
* As a user, I want to be able to personalize my player
* As a user, I want a game that is interactive.

## **Your Wireframes – sketches of major views / interfaces in your application**
***
I didn't end up sticking very close to my original wireframe. I came up with a lot of ideas along the way and how I wanted to style it changed numerous times.

## **Descriptions of any Unsolved problems or major hurdles you had to overcome**
***
* Making code DRY - Noticed a lot of places where I could've made my code more DRY, but it was difficult to see that as I came up with a lot as I went along and thus didn't plan for it. Going back later, I plan on making my code much shorter and cleaner. I kind of get stuck in the groove and want to just churn it all out.

* Styling - I am not 100% happy with the styling. I wanted the final product to have more of a consistent design, but I got strapped for time as I wanted to make sure the features I planned for got in.

* Responsiveness - I really wanted to get to making the app responsive for mobile, but got strapped for time.


**Resolutions**

I'm definitely going to be going back to clean up my code where I can as well as include more annotating, making it responsive, and more work on the design. A little disappointed I wasn't able to make the app responsive for mobile in time as well as make the design better, but I had a lot of fun in this project nonetheless.
